# Variables

C++ is a statically typed language, therefore each declaration of a variable
requires that it's type is specified. The general syntax to declare a variable is:

```
Type name = <Initializer>;
```

The initializer is optional, however, it's good practice to **always initialize
variables when they're declared**.

In the example you can see two variables declare, each with the result of their
initializer. `answer` is than printed to the console.
