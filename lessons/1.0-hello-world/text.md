# Hello, World

Welcome to the tour of the [C++ programming language].

The tour is divided into multiple chapters, while each chapter is further
divided into multiple lessons. You can access all available chapters by
clicking on the menu on the top left of the page.

The tour is fully interactive. The code in the editor on the right can be run
by clicking on the *Run* button below, or using `Ctrl-Enter` while typing.
The *Reset* button will discard all changes and reset it back to the default for
the current lesson. It's useful if you ever need to start over.

The output of the compiler and your program will be shown in the panel below it.
Give it a try!

Any function or class we mention throughout the tour, will be marked as such and
will show a short documentation if hovered. For example [`puts`]. Clicking on it
will open the documentation on [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com).

You can navigate through the tour by using the next and previous buttons
on the bottom of the page.

Click next when you're ready to begin.
