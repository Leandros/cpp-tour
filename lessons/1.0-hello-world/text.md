# Hello, World

Welcome to the tour of the [C++ programming language].

The tour is divided into multiple chapters, while each chapter is divided into several lessons.
You can access all available chapters by clicking on the menu on the top left of the page.

The tour is fully interactive. The code in the editor on the right can be run
by clicking on the *Run* button below, or using `Ctrl-Enter` while typing.

The output of the compiler and your program will be shown in the panel below it.
Give it a try!

Any function or class we mention throughout the tour, will be marked as such and
will show a short documentation if hovered. For example [`puts`].

You can navigate through the tour by using the next and previous buttons
on the bottom of the page.

Click next when you're ready to begin.
