# C++ Tour Mission Statement

The goal of the C++ tour project is to create a new way of teaching C++.
First and foremost we want to target those, who already have some experience
in programming, but are new to C++ or return after a longer absence.

We want to guide through features of the language and standard library, showing
pitfalls and best practices. The tour will be split into lessons. Each lesson
is teaching a single concept or language feature and will be accompanied by an
interactive example, demonstrating the concept and allowing for experimentation.

In the future, it's planned to add a wider variety of lessons, including, but
not limited to:
  - Highlighting new language features
  - Beginner lessons, teaching beginners to program in C++

Which will add further value to the C++ tour, for both experienced C++
programmers and complete beginners.

The content will be hosted on Github, to allow for easy collaboration, changes
and improvements, similar to the CppCoreGuidelines.


On behalf of the project team,
