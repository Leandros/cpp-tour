# Includes

Functions of the [C++ standard library] are declared in header files, the function
[`puts`], for example, is declared inside [`stdio.h`].

To get access to the function, we need to use the [`#include`] statement.
In the example, [`stdio.h`] is included, which will make the standard input
and output routines available for use.

One of the functions declared is [`puts`].

[`puts`] is taking a single string argument, and printing it to the console.

Try changing the string, or adding more calls to [`puts`]. You'll see the output
of the program in the console.
